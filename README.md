# Monopoly_Board_Builder
Java 2 Final Term Project. Allow users to build boards for the Monopoly game I created in Java 1.

This repo contains the files that are needed for the database/web project.

- You do not have to fill in every form. All the forms have error checking, and if they find an error they will use the placeholder as the value for that field.
Example: You try to enter "A" in a field that needs to contain a number. The placeholder for that field will be used instead of "A".
